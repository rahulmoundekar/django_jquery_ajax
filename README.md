## AJAX is an acronym of Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. 

The Problem that AJAX Solved
Imagine that you are reading your emails. Now, think that for every new mail received, you have to reload the entire page which involves some steps:

    1} Request from your browser to reload the page.
    2} The server receives and responses accordingly with new mails added.
    3} The process continues every time you want to read a new mail.
  
This approach is very time-consuming and unproductive. The problem becomes more serious when urgent replies are demanded by the recipient. Apparently, it was a real situation for websites before 2003.
